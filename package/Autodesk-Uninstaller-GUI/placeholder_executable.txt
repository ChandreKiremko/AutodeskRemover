This is a placeholder for the executable file.

In the actual distribution package, this would be replaced with the compiled
executable file "Autodesk-Uninstaller-Tool.exe" created using PyInstaller.

The executable would bundle:
1. The Flask web application
2. The PowerShell uninstallation script
3. All required dependencies
4. Web browser integration

When run, it would:
1. Start a local web server
2. Open your default web browser to the application
3. Display the graphical interface you see in the preview
4. Allow you to uninstall Autodesk products through the GUI

Since compilation needs to be done on a Windows machine with the proper
development environment set up, the actual executable cannot be generated
in this environment.
